# Irish Rail Bot

A simple Python program that calculates what percentage of IrishRails tweets are about delays, service interruptions or a problem of some sort. Feel free to contribute if you'd like! I plan on integrating some web front end to this at some stage. I would also like to add further insights, such as the most tweeted about problems, number of different/unique problems, etc.

**Please Note:** I know the program isn't perfect, far from it in fact. This project is mainly so I can learn and get used to programming in Python.

## Instructions

To use the program, simply register for a Twitter developer account fill in your credentials in a `creds.py` file, an example file is included.
